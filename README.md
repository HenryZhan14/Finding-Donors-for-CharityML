# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

•	Used a supervised learning model to identify potential donors using the U.S. census data

•	Performed data cleansing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis

•	Created a training and predicting pipeline to train and evaluate multiple classification models (logistic regression, SVM, GBDT)

•	Used cross validation and grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model (GBDT) (accuracy = 0.87 on testing data)

•	Selected five most relevant features by feature importance, and retrained the GBDT model with the selected five features, leading to a 20% decrease in training time with only 2% accuracy reduction
